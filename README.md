Cinema Room Manager 

Description

The theatre is getting popular, and the customers started complaining that it's not practical that the program stops after buying one ticket. Let's add a menu that will allow them to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement when needed.

Objectives

At the start, your program should read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row. Then, it should print a menu with the following three items:

Show the seats should print the current seating arrangement. The empty seats should be marked with an S symbol, and taken seats are marked with a B symbol.

Buy a ticket should read the seat coordinates from the input and print the ticket price like in the previous stage. After that, the chosen seat should be marked with a B when the item Show the seats is called.

Exit should stop the program.
